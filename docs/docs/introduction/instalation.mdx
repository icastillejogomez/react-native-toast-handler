# Instalation

## Install Reanimated

This library use under the hood the [Reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated) library to animate the toasts. So you need to install it in your project:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="expo" label="Expo" default>

```bash
npx expo install react-native-reanimated
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated --save
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning
At this moment, we don't check the compatibility between this library and the Reanimated version. If you have any problem with this, please open an issue in the [repository](https://github.com/icastillejogomez/react-native-toast-handler).
:::

### Reanimated babel preset
In case you are using Expo, you don't need to add the babel preset as they [say in their documentation].(https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/reanimated/). But in case you are using a different framework or React Native CLI, you need to add the Reanimated babel preset to your `babel.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    // highlight-next-line
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
  ],
};
```

Any ways, we encourage you to reed the [Reanimated instalation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) to learn more about it.
