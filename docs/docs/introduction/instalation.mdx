### Wrap your application with GestureHandlerRootView

In the [Getting Started](/docs/gettings-started) page, we are going to see that is necessary wrap the ToastProvider with a GestureHandlerRootView component. This component will handle the gestures in order to handle the swipes movements.

```jsx
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* content */}
    </GestureHandlerRootView>
  );
}
```

:::info[Learn more about React Native Gesture Handler instalation]
You can learn more about the instalation of React Native Gesture Handler in the [React Native Gesture Handler documentation](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/fundamentals/installation).
:::

### Reanimated babel preset
In case you are using Expo, you don't need to add the babel preset as they [say in their documentation].(https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/reanimated/). But in case you are using a different framework or React Native CLI, you need to add the Reanimated babel preset to your `babel.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    // highlight-next-line
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
  ],
};
```

Any ways, we encourage you to reed the [Reanimated instalation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) to learn more about it.
